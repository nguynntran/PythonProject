## MY PERSONAL PYTHON PROJECT: CALORIES BURNT USING MACHINE LEARNING ##

I. Description:
- I will build a machine learning model using Python which can predict the number of calories a person has burnt during a workout based on some biological measures.
- I will importing datasets, after that I will analize datasets, visualize the datatset to discover trends and patterns.
- Next step, I will separate the features and target variables and split them into training and testing data 
- I will find the prediction for calories burnt which related to some features likes body temperature, duration of workout, weight, height and so on,....

II. Functionality:
- This model will give you a visualization of two datasets, which are imported.
- Show you the trend of dataset, and give you prediction of calories burnt during workout exercise.

III. Architecture:
- I will import some libraries: pandas, numpy, mathplotlib, season, sklearn and so on for analyzing, visualizing datasets and predicting the calories burnt.
- Using XGBoost algorithms to predict calories burnt.
